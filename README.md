# LaptopBrandRecognition
Using a simple image classifier based on Lesson 2 of fastai's Deep Learning course to check what brand a laptop is.

Only 3 brands have been used here: Apple's Macbook, HP and Lenovo. This method will work if the number of brands is increased too.

All coding is given with explanation in the iPython notebook. The dataset containing the URLs of the images is also attached, which was webscraped from Google Images.
